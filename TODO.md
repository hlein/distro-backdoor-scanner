# Current TODOs

- Add support for an RPM-based distro (Rocky Linux)

- Better annotation/attribution of existing patterns

- More search patterns

- Better (any) usage documentation

- Add example output, triaging of false-positives

- Add command-line knobs

- Investigate packages that do not unpack successfully (per-distro)

- Smartly (re)scan different phases - after fresh unpack, then after
  applying distro patches

- Convert this list to GH issues... maybe
