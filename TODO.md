# Current TODOs

- Add more distro families (ironically tracked in [README](README.md)
  instead of here)

- Better annotation/attribution of existing patterns

- More search patterns

- Better (any) usage documentation

- Add example output, triaging of false-positives

- Add command-line knobs

- Investigate packages that do not unpack successfully (per-distro)

- Smartly (re)scan different phases - after fresh unpack, then after
  applying distro patches; this will differ by distro

- Convert this list to GH issues... maybe
